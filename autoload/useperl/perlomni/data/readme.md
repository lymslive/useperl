# Perl Omnicomplete Data: simple file syntax

Just like pod, but only `=item` accepted.
It is for easy config list data.

For example, `file.pod` has following content lines:

```
=item key1
val1_1
val1_2
val1_3
...

=item key2
val2_1
val2_2
val2_3
```

Then each key will get a list value from the next lines.

When convert to vim data struct, it equals such command:
```
let file = {}
let file.key1 = ['val1_1', 'val1_2', 'val1_3']
let file.key2 = ['val2_1', 'val2_2', 'val2_3']
```

Empty line is discard.

If there is no `=item key`, the only defaut key `list` is used, something
like: `let file.list = readfile(file)` .

The `*.pod` data files can be handwrite edited, or generated by script.
